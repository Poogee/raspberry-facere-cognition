# Real-time Face Recognition on Raspberry PI using ~~C Lang~~ Python and face_recognition module

A little attempt at running a face recognition program on a Raspberry Pi 2. It works decently, however every 200th frame it lags out a bit to look for faces.

The code sucks, please don't look at it.

Just use TensorFlow Lite or something else if you want to have decent performance on a Raspberry.
